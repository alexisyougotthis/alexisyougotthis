<h2>Update: 12 March </h2>
<p>I am reading breaking the habit of being yourself. For a year I am thinking as many positive thoughts as possible. I am reading Breaking the Habit of being yourself. You can literally change the shape of your DNA in 2 minutes if you combine thoughts and feelings. Thats incredible.</p>

<h4> What I have accomplished in 2023 so far. </h4>
<p>I have made a good friend in Sam. I have gone for sushi. I have attended every tennis match but 1. I am about to take part in the Argus. I have a great friend Ivan, who I have had conversations with for >3 hrs, and go to yoga with every weekend. I have rekindled a friendship with Nabeel. I have built 2 websites and have been paid R4500 for one of them. I watched the Padel tournament for 3 days in total. I have played close to 15 padel matches this year and networked. I got the M2 Macbook Pro and made the right purchase. I have read Dune and Dune: Messiah. I have been to the gym 10 times. I have done 3 meditation sessions. </p>

<h3>Why am I doing this</h3>
<p>I may not have a purpose in life completely worked out, but things have changed. I am no longer going to do what I do not want to do. Do what you enjoy doing. Because what's the point if you don't enjoy it -- Grandpa Basil.</p>

<h5>I am actively working on a ikigai/eudaimonia. In the meantime, my life's purpose is to have fun and make others have fun. And level up my mind again and again and again, to its intended exceptional form. </h5>


<h2>Quote:</h2>
<p><b>I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the imposssible. </b>The fact that sokething seems impossible.
 The fact that something seems impossible shouldn't be a reason not to pursue it. Where would the courage and greatness be of success was
 certain and there was no risk, The only true failure is shrinking away from life's challenges. </p>

<h2>My 2023 main goals:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Make friends</li>
</ul>
<h3>Update 1: 16th February 2023</h3>
<p>First post. This is a website to me, from me. I am going to use this website as an Alexis bible. I'll put all the quotes, 
goals, lists and write down my accomplishments. Right now, I am probably like 12 days into no porn. I know for a fact that I will never watch it again.
Yesterday I started a challenge with Teresa - first person to 1 million rand wins. My first order of business is to take adavantage of 
the Tiktok promotion, to make R1200 per account. Let's see how this post turns out.</p>

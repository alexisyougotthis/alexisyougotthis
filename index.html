<p><b>I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the imposssible. </b>The fact that sokething seems impossible.
 The fact that something seems impossible shouldn't be a reason not to pursue it. Where would the courage and greatness be of success was
 certain and there was no risk, The only true failure is shrinking away from life's challenges. </p>

<h3>Update 1: 16th February 2023</h3>
<p>First post. This is a website to me, from me. I am going to use this website as an Alexis bible. I'll put all the quotes, 
goals, lists and write down my accomplishments. Right now, I am probably like 12 days into no porn. I know for a fact that I will never watch it again.
Yesterday I started a challenge with Teresa - first person to 1 million rand wins. My first order of business is to take adavantage of 
the Tiktok promotion, to make R1200 per account. Let's see how this post turns out.</p>
